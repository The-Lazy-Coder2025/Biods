🕊️ Boids Flocking Simulation

A real-time, customizable boids simulation built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.

<!-- Optional: Add an actual screenshot or GIF -->

🎯 Overview

This project simulates flocking behavior using the classic Boids algorithm, where each agent ("boid") follows three simple rules:

Separation – avoid crowding neighbors
Alignment – steer toward average heading of neighbors
Cohesion – steer toward average position of neighbors
Combined, these rules create lifelike swarm movement—all rendered directly in your browser!

🚀 Features

🧠 Adjustable simulation parameters (separation, alignment, cohesion, vision, speed)
🔥 Toggle between multiple boid styles (arrow, triangle, comet, bird)
🦈 Add predators for chaotic interactions
🧩 Smooth, performant rendering with HTML5 Canvas
🎨 Modern, responsive UI with CSS gradients and controls
